About
======
Hi! I'm Josh, a Research Associate based at Loughborough University.
My work focuses on the influence of sediment transport and geomorphic change on flood risk, using a combination of numerical modelling and field observations. I'm interested in how natural flood management influences geomorphic change, and what this means for future flood risk. I also use a range of immersive technology (360 cameras and 3D models) to capture areas that may not be accessible. My other interests include the use of aritifical intelligence for remote sensing, and the use of hyperspectral data for quantifying soil carbon.
