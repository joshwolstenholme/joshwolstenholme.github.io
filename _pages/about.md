Hi! I'm Josh, a Research Associate based at Loughborough University. This is my personal page, but you can check out my staff one [here](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/subjects/geography-environment/staff/josh-wolstenholme/){:target="_blank"}.

My work focuses on the influence of sediment transport and geomorphic change on flood risk, using a combination of numerical modelling and field observations.

I'm interested in how natural flood management influences geomorphic change, and what this means for future flood risk. I also use a range of immersive technology (360 cameras and 3D models) to capture areas that may not be accessible. My other interests include the use of artificial intelligence for remote sensing, and the use of hyperspectral data for quantifying soil carbon.

## Background

I completed my PhD in Physical Geography in 2023 at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, with a focus on understanding the impact of leaky wooden dams on fluvial geomorphology, ultimately integrating these observations into a landscape evolution model.

Prior to this, I completed a Masters by Research looking at surface hydrological connectivity in semi-arid environments at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, and a BSc in Geological Sciences, also at Leeds.
